# Legacy code

This code is more similar to the original project documented [here](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/recipes-scraping-top-20-recipes-allrecipes). This code may require MongoDB and other installations. In order to run, you will need to start MongoDB database.  

```
$ mongod       # Starts database
```

Open a new terminal window to run the script

```
$ ./modifiedfromoriginal.py
```

Use iPython notebook (**export_MongoDB.ipynb**) to export from MongoDB to a tabular file.
